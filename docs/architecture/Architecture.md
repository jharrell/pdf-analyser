The best architecture and hosting method for your application would depend on various factors such as the expected traffic, scalability requirements, budget, and the level of technical expertise of your team. However, I can suggest a few options for you to consider:

1. Architecture: A common architecture for applications that involve storing PDF files and using a machine learning model to generate responses is a serverless architecture. In this architecture, you can use AWS Lambda to execute code in response to events such as a new PDF file upload or a user's query. You can use Amazon S3 to store the PDF files, Amazon API Gateway to handle user requests, and Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon Aurora for database storage.

2. Hosting: Both Vercel and AWS offer hosting services that can support your application's requirements. Vercel is a platform that specializes in serverless deployment of web applications, which can be an advantage for your architecture. On the other hand, AWS provides more flexibility and control over the infrastructure, which can be beneficial for more complex applications.

3. Vector Database: For storing and searching through PDF files, you may want to consider using a vector database such as Pinecone. With Pinecone, you can store PDFs as embeddings in the database and use machine learning models to search through them efficiently. Pinecone also offers integrations with various cloud providers including AWS, which can simplify your hosting requirements.

In summary, a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon DynamoDB or Aurora, along with a vector database such as Pinecone, could be a good option for your application. You can choose to host it on either Vercel or AWS, depending on your specific needs and preferences.
